I am a **postdoctoral associate** at **MIT Sloan School of Management**, working with [Prof. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu). Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at Purdue University with [Prof. David E. Bernal Neira](https://secquoia.github.io/1-bernalde.html). I received my Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University and, during this period, spent one year as a visiting scholar in [Prof. Ignacio E. Grossmann](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/grossmann-ignacio.html)â€™s group at Carnegie Mellon University. After graduation, I worked for two years in industry at [JD.com](https://corporate.jd.com/home) as a Doctoral Management Trainee before transitioning to academia.

My current research focuses on developing **scalable and efficient computational approaches to enhance decision-making in complex systems**, including
- GPU-accelerated algorithm design and implementation for Linear Programming.
- Algorithm design and implementation for Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming.
- Applications in online advertising, supply chain, finance and energy systems.

### Software
I am a strong advocate of **open-source and high-performance optimization tools**. I have developed and maintain several widely used solvers and libraries, including:
- [MPAX: Mathematical Programming in JAX](https://github.com/MIT-Lu-Lab/MPAX/)
- [cuPDLPx: A GPU-Accelerated First-Order LP Solver](https://github.com/MIT-Lu-Lab/cuPDLPx)
- [MindtPy: The Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Decomposition Toolbox in Pyomo](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/explanation/solvers/mindtpy.html)

### Teaching Experience

- TA, 15.071. **The Analytics Edge** (MBA), MIT, Fall 2025
- TA, **Data Mining and Data Fusion** (Graduate), Zhejiang University, Winter 2016
- TA, **Operations Research** (Graduate), Zhejiang University, Fall 2016


<!-- . My work integrates a broad range of methodologies, including mathematical modeling, algorithm design, uncertainty quantification, and hardware-accelerated solver implementation, with a strong emphasis on open-source and high-performance tools. -->
